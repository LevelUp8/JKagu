# JKagu

<p>JKagu is a search replace software with GUI interface. It works based on rows of the text file. It can be very effective with large text files containing rows which are not relevant for the user or the user need to perform automatic operation on many rows. Such files can be for example source code or log files.</p>

<h2>Functionalities:</h2>

<p>The application has Select area where user can perform normal select, query select and from until select. The idea is to filter out the rows of the text which are not important. After that there is replace area which has drop down and many functionalities like replace all occurrences of a word in each row, split row based on separators or adding to the beginning/end of each row a string. For the full list of possibilities please see Replace. At the bottom there is the text itself. User can copy it or can save it as txt file. The application is not created as normal editor with purpose to be as light as possible. It can show hundred of thousands of rows without problem.</p>

The program was created with Java and Java FX and for the building it was used Amazon Correto 17 (build for Ubuntu) and Open JDK 17 (build for Windows).
